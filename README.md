# Todo Backend JS Specs

Due to CORS restrictions, it might be more suitable to run a test environment locally. To do so, please follow the below instructions.

## Installation 

- Make sure `Node.js` and `npm` are installed.
- Run 
```bash 
npm install -g http-server
```
## Running
In the home directory run
```bash
http-server -p ${PORT}
```
and find your test environment available at [http://localhost:${PORT}](http://localhost:${PORT}).

Here ${PORT} must either be substituted or exported.
